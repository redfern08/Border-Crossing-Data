The data set is available from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae).  This

## Project Details
I am working on collecting data on border crossing entries from 2020 to 2023 and want to see how many crossings there were, methods used for the crossings 
and the states and borders which were crossed.  This in turn can hopefully be used to establish better border security which is the goal.
